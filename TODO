TODO:

    [ ] experiment with database workers to minimise connection times to db
        (connecting to DB for each call seems expensive)
    [ ] look into connection pooling for postgres
    [ ] improved front end:
            [ ] more presentable ("prettier") front end
            [ ] look at enabling accounts:
                    [ ] favouriting posts
                    [ ] pushover on new posts
                    note: this may be unnecessary (i.e. would people actually 
                    want it), but would be good experience at writing webapp
                    code.
